# Lecture-1: Project management fundamentals

## routine work vs project work

### routine work (support work)

answering questions, going to regularly scheduled meeting

### project work

a project is a temporary activity with a starting date, specific goals and condition, defined responsibilities, a budget, a fixed end date and multiple parties involved. For example, wedding.

#### goal

project's goal must produce something tangible and add value to the organization

## The Four constraints of Project

1. Scope constraint (what is the project trying to accomplish?)
2. Time constraint (how long should it take to complete?)
3. Cost constraint (what should it cost?)
4. Quality constraint (what defect level?)

normally we can only have 3 of the 4

## generic project life cycle

define project goal > plan project > execute project plan > close project > evaluate project

## system development life cycle (inside executre project plan)

planning > analysis > design > implementation > maintenance & support

## tool for project management

### low-end tools

e.g. MS excel, Milestones Simplicity

### Midrange tools

handle multiple projects and users. e.g. Microsoft Project

### High-end tools

also colled enterprise project management software. e.g. AMS realtime, Primavera project manager

# Lecture-2: Integration management

- project integration management includes the process required to ensure that the various element of the project are properly corrdinated
- it involves making tradeoffs

## project IM processes

1. develop project charter (initialing)
2. develop PM plan (planning)
3. direct and manage project work (executing)
4. monitor and control project work (monitoring)
5. perform integrated change control (monitoring)
6. colse project or phase (closing)

## 1. developer project charter

### select a project

5 methods:

- based on organizational needs (need, fund and strong will)
- categorizing projects (categorize all project then select top ones within each category)
- financial analyses
  - NPV
  - ROI
  - payback analysis
- weighted scoring model (selects projects based on many criteria)
- balanced scorecard method

### Defining Measuable Organizational Value (MOV)

### project charter

project charter is a formal, typically short document that describes your project in its entirety — including what the objectives are, how it will be carried out, and who the stakeholders are. It is a crucial ingredient in planning the project because it is used throughout the project lifecycle.

#### why project charter is important

- it makes the project manager's role legit
- it makes the project legit
- it sets the target for the project

## 2. develop PM plan (planning)

take results of other planning processes (e.g., test plan, quality plan, risk plan) and putting them into a consistent, coherent document -> project plan

when we develop a PM plan, need to know the constrants, dependencies and assumptions.

## 3. direct and manage project work (executing)

## 4. monitor and control project work (monitoring)

- performance measures enable PM to track whether the projects are moving in the right direction
- track KPIs on a monthly basis

## 5. perform integrated change control (monitoring)

### configuraton baseline

- configuration:
  ⏲️
- baseline:
  - a collection of item versions that have been formally reviewed and agreed on
  - marks milestone and serves as basis for further development
  - can only be changed via formal change management process
  - baseline + change sets to create new baselines

### how to manage changes

recognize the change -> categorise it by priority and size -> decide on what to do: action, reject or defer

priority: essential, useful, cosmetic

size: fundamental, tolerate, trivial

### change control system

- a formal, documented process that describe when and how official project documents and work may be changed
- describe who is authorized to make change and how to make them
- offen included Change control board (CCB), a group of people responsible for approving or rejecting changes on a project.

### configuration management

4 steps:

1. configuration identification
2. configuration control
3. configuration status accounting
4. configuration audit

## 6. colse project or phase (closing)

### activies of closure

- product verification
- close out procurement
- update organizational process assets (HR need to add new skill acquired to team members)
- document lessons learned
- archive project document

# Terms:

- PMI: Project Management Institute (professon society)
- project's owner: is an individual person or a group of people that owns the final IT solution
- project manager: responsible about ensuring that all the project management tools, method and tech details are in place properly. He defines quality standdards and measures.
- CCB: Change control board
