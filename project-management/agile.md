# Agile
An iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.

Disadvantage
1. Documentation can be neglected: The Agile Manifesto prefers working software over comprehensive documentation, so some team members may feel like it’s less important to focus on documentation.

## Scrum
Scrum is an agile framework for developing, testing, delivering on software development.

### Benefit:
1. Better Quality: Scrum provides the framework for <b>continual feedback</b> and exposure to make sure that quality is as high as possible.

### Drawback:
1. Each developer’s role may not be well defined

### Story point
Difficulty of the story

### Velocity 
The story point completed by the team during the sprint

### MoSCoW
MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could and Won’t) Analysis is a technique that
helps users to prioritise each requirement based on its importance.

## XP

### Different from Scrum
#### 1. Shorter time:
In Scrum framework, team work in iterations called Sprint which are 1-2 month long.	In Extreme Programming(XP), teamwork for 1-2 weeks only.

#### 2. Flexibility:
Scrum model do not allow changes in their timeline or their guidelines.	Extreme Programming allow changes in their set timelines.

#### 3. Priority:
Extreme Programming teams work in a strict priority order. Features to be developed are prioritized by the customer (Scrum’s Product Owner) and the team is required to work on them in that order. 

By contrast, the Scrum product owner prioritizes the product backlog but the team determines the sequence in which they will develop the backlog items.
