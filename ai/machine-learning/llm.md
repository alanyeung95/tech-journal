# Gen AI

Generative artificial intelligence is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models, often in response to prompts.

## Dall-E

Trained on a large data set of images and their associated text descriptions, Dall-E is an example of a multimodal AI application that identifies connections across multiple media, such as vision, text and audio. In this case, it connects the meaning of words to visual elements. It was built using OpenAI's GPT implementation in 2021. Dall-E 2, a second, more capable version, was released in 2022. It enables users to generate imagery in multiple styles driven by user prompts.

### Architecture

DALL·E is based on a modified version of the GPT architecture, adapted to handle both textual and visual information. It uses a method known as "zero-shot" text-to-image generation, which allows it to create images from descriptions without needing direct examples of the description during training.

### Key Differences
Purpose: GPT models are focused on understanding and generating text, whereas DALL·E is focused on creating images from textual descriptions.
Output: GPT outputs text, while DALL·E outputs images.
Underlying Technology: Both use variations of the Transformer architecture, but they are trained and function in fundamentally different ways to suit their specific tasks.
