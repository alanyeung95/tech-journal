You can break the task into two problems: getting the signature into an image format using a signature pad of some kind, then you need to render a PDF with that image file included.

So something like this for the signature and you could use react-pdf for the PDF. Although you should consider lazy loading as itâ€™s a big library, or render the PDF on the server to prevent bloating your UI.
