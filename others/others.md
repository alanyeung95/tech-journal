1. Bugs that affect the build or deployment of production
2. Bugs that affect the progress of other developers

## Difficult tasks

Apart from reading the story/ticklet and coding, there are 3 essences we need in order to deliver the solution.

- understand the user workflow according to the requirement, for designing happy path of our code.

- dealing with edge cases, sometimes we need input from user.
