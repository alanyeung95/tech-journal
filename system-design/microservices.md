# Benefits

## Scalability
We can scale services differently. For example, 2 instances for frontend and 4 instances for backend

## Optimization
Services can be implemented using different programming languages, databases and software environments. 
For example python for AI part, vuejs/reactjs for frontend, golang as backend, java-based elasticsearch for searching

## Code reuseability
Domain model sharing

## Ease of understanding
Codes and respibilities get seperated very well

# Disadvantages
## Communication between services is complex
E.g. Docker network & nginx configuration, API gateway setting

## Global testing is difficult
End-to-end testing
