## Node
3 states: natural, true, false

Repeat until decision is made:
1. A validator is presented with a set of transactions that have been issued and asked to decide which transactions to “Accept.”
2. The validator selects a subset of these transactions that do not conflict, marks them as preferred, and attempts to accept them over the network
3. This validator selects **K nodes** from the entire validator list 
   * consecutiveSuccesses meet the threshold
   * decide(preference)
4. The validator state will change to the color of the majority neighbours (quorum size)

Even it is 50/50 situation, it will fall to any of the state

## Scalability
Snowball is very scalable as the number of nodes on the network, n, increases. Regardless of the number of participants in the network, the number of consensus messages sent remains the same because in a given query, a node only queries 20 nodes, even if there are thousands of nodes in the network.
