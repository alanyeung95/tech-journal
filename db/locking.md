In the context of database operations and concurrency control, there are two main locking strategies

## Pessimistic Locking

**Pessimistic locking** assumes that conflicts are likely to happen and therefore takes a conservative approach by locking data before it's read or modified, preventing other transactions from accessing the locked data until the lock is released. This approach is similar to traditional locking mechanisms, such as read and write locks, that directly prevent concurrent access to data.

- **Usage**: Pessimistic locking is typically used when the likelihood of data conflicts is high, or when the cost of a transaction failure is significant. It is common in systems where data integrity is critical and conflicts are common.
- **Implementation**: This can be done through explicit table locks, row locks, or other database-specific locking mechanisms.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Locks data early to prevent concurrent modifications.
  - Can lead to deadlocks if not managed correctly.
  - May impact system performance due to longer wait times for locked resources.

## Optimistic Locking

**Optimistic locking**, in contrast, assumes that conflicts are rare and does not lock data when it's read. Instead, it checks if the data was modified by another transaction before it commits changes. If a conflict is detected (usually through version numbering or timestamps), the transaction is rolled back, and the application can retry the operation.

- **Usage**: Optimistic locking is used when the likelihood of conflicts is low, which makes it suitable for high-concurrency environments or systems where locking-induced delays are unacceptable.
- **Implementation**: This often involves adding a version number or timestamp to each record. When updating a record, the transaction checks if the recordâ€™s version number has changed since it was last read. If it has, the update is aborted because another transaction has modified the record.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Does not prevent other transactions from accessing data simultaneously.
  - Reduces the potential for deadlocks.
  - Suitable for applications with low conflict rates but high levels of concurrency.

### Examples

**Pessimistic Locking Example**:
In SQL Server, you might use a `SELECT` statement with a locking hint to ensure pessimistic locking:

```sql
SELECT * FROM accounts WITH (UPDLOCK, HOLDLOCK) WHERE account_id = 1;
```

**Optimistic Locking Example**:
In a system with a `version` column in a table, an update might look like this:

```sql
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 100, version = version + 1
WHERE account_id = 1 AND version = @version;
```

Here, `@version` is the version number read by the application. If the version has changed since it was read, the `UPDATE` statement affects 0 rows, indicating a conflict.
